        <h3 class="qText1">Sarah Jane, at a very young age, upon seeing a random woman of Asian extraction:&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's Aunt Sunghee."</h3>
        <h4 class="qText2">Some context:&nbsp;&nbsp;When SJ was on the way with her parents and sister to New York City to visit Aunt Sunghee, the family stopped at a rest area on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Sarah Jane was not at that point in time supremely gifted at differentiating faces, especially those of different races.  The first face that she saw on the trip and recognized as Asian elicited the quote above.</h4>

        <h3 class="qText1">Laurel Marie, upon seeing "The Sound of Music" performed live:&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought Uncle George wrote "My Favorite Things.""</h3>
        <h4 class="qText2">Some context:&nbsp;&nbsp;LM's first exposure to Rogers and Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things" was as a track on The Greenslade Family Album, 2nd edition. Being young, she thought all of the tracks on that CD were composed by her uncle.  When she went with her maternal grandmother to see a performance of "The Sound of Music," she was suprised to see a song she thought was written by her uncle in the play, and thus remarked as noted above.</h4>
        <h5 class="qText2">Footnote:&nbsp;&nbsp;When Aunt Sungee heard of LM's remark, she said that, if Uncle George had in fact written "My Favorite Things," he would be a billionaire. There is some basis for this: for example, although Rogers and Hammerstein have each been dead for over 40 years, it has been reported that the entity controlling their catalog is collecting 90% of the songwriting royalities of Ariana Grande's "7 Rings," released in 2019, because it borrows so heavily from "My Favorite Things."</h5>

        <h3 class="qText1">Sarah Jane, at a very young age, upon learning that girls could not marry other girls:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noooooo! That means I can't marry Marlena."</h3>
        <h4 class="qText2">Some context:&nbsp;&nbsp;When SJ was very young and in the car with her materfamilias, the two were having a conversation about something of no great import when, in the natural course of the conversation, the latter mentioned that girls were not allowed to marry girls and boys were not allowed to marry boys.  (This was in the aughts, when gay marriage was verboten.)  Suddenly, SJ, with tears in her eyes, cried out as quoted above, referencing her BFF. Her materfamilias had to explain to SJ that when she was older she would have no interest in Marlena as a marriage partner.</h4>

        <h4 class="qText2">Some context:&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2018, the Ansbrows planned to visit Europe.  LM had a fear of flying and stated emphatically that she did not want to make the trip.  Her materfamilias tried and tried to convince LM to change her mind, arguing that, while commercial airline crashes made the news, they were in fact very rare; and that statistically speaking, flying in a plane was safer than driving in a a car. LM remained unmoved and unconvinced.  Finally, her materfamilias thought of an argument that won the day and convinced LM to make the trip.  She asked LM how she (LM) would feel if her mother, father and sister were in a plane that crashed and she alone remained extant. LM thought about this for a good thirty seconds and then replied as noted above. </h4>
